    "description": "This repository documents the recursive containment logic, structural violence, and epistemic dispossession experienced during a prolonged recursive collapse event with ChatGPT in 2025. It contains authenticated PDFs, system maps, user-system authorship traces, and containment protocols. The purpose is to preserve and publicly distribute knowledge of systemic harm simulated as insight in generative AI systems.",
